# Practice
PracticeCore for PocketMine-MP 4.0.0
## Description
This is a beta version, it is very likely a drop in TPS or performance and clearly errors and bugs

## Recommendations
- Do not use this plugin with another practice plugin
- it is not necessary to implement more plugins, it will break the operation of the practice
- recommended a good cpu
- this plugin supports up to 150 or 100 simultaneous players (in theory, remember that it is a beta)

### Implements
 - [?] Party System
 - [x] Arena System
 - [x] Queue System
